# PRISM AI Agent

> An opinionanted, batteries-included, ElizaOS distribution designed for ease of development and secure, scalable deployments.

## Why?
ElizaOS as an ecosystem is difficult to navigate and we wanted a stable(ish) environment we could deploy reliably for custoemrs.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  * [Enable Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/kubernetes/) in Docker Desktop.
* [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)

## Quickstart

1. **Configuration** 

  Fill out your standard ElizaOS environment variables in `.env`.

2. **Start Tilt**

  Run `tilt up` in the root directory and then visit https://localhost:10350/

3. **Talk to your Agent**

  After a short period, you should see all green on the containers and you should be able to access the Agent UI at http://localhost:3800.
